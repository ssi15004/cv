  Ever since high school I was very interested in the study of computer science in general, and computer networks and embedded systems in particular, mainly due to the many existing open research challenges and a lot of interesting applications in these areas. 
  I first began the study of computer science in high school because I wanted to understand more the functioning of the computers, both from the software that the hardware perspective. 
  After graduation, I chose the faculty of Computer Science at the University of Camerino to pursue a bachelor and master degree, in line with my high school diploma. 
  I had classes oriented mainly towards theoretical computer science. 
  During my bachelors I followed classes on algorithms and data structures, logics, calculus, numerical analysis, statistics and operational research. 
  Coherent with my bachelor education, I further deepened my theoretical knowledge during my masters. 
  I followed courses such as model checking, theory of complexity, and modelling and simulation.

  Wanting to gain some more practical computer science knowledge, I took the opportunity to go on Erasmus during my masters. 
  I went to MÃ¤lardalen University in Sweden to immerse myself into one of my original passions, embedded systems design. 
  I followed several courses that were not available in my own university, about scheduling and management of real time embedded systems. 
  Being abroad, and studying in a more practical research-oriented environment, the idea to pursue a PhD started growing in my mind.

  As such, I was very happy when I stumbled upon an open research position at the University of Antwerp during Summer 2016, to investigate heterogeneous low-power wireless communications protocols for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. 
  I discovered that IoT research finds itself on the intersection between embedded systems, wireless communications, and data analytic, which perfectly aligns with my original passions.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
